<h1 class="ltx_title ltx_title_chapter">Preface</h1>

<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The origin of the name ‚ÄúNapkin‚Äù
comes from the following quote of mine.</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">I‚Äôll be eating a quick lunch with some friends of mine
who are still in high school.
They‚Äôll ask me what I‚Äôve been up to the last few weeks,
and I‚Äôll tell them that I‚Äôve been learning category theory.
They‚Äôll ask me what category theory is about.
I tell them it‚Äôs about abstracting things by looking at just the
structure-preserving morphisms between them, rather than the objects themselves.
I‚Äôll try to give them the standard example <math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathsf{Grp}" display="inline"><mi>ùñ¶ùóãùóâ</mi></math>,
but then I‚Äôll realize that they don‚Äôt know what a homomorphism is.
So then I‚Äôll start trying to explain what a homomorphism is,
but then I‚Äôll remember that they haven‚Äôt learned what a group is.
So then I‚Äôll start trying to explain what a group is,
but by the time I finish writing the group axioms on my napkin,
they‚Äôve already forgotten why I was talking about groups in the first place.
And then it‚Äôs 1PM, people need to go places, and I can‚Äôt help but think: 
<br class="ltx_break">
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">‚ÄúMan, if I had forty hours instead of forty minutes,
I bet I could actually have explained this all‚Äù.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ltx_p">This book was initially my attempt at those forty hours,
but has grown considerably since then.</p>
</div>
<section id="Sx1" class="ltx_section">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">About this book</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Infinitely Large Napkin</em> is a light
but mostly self-contained introduction to a large
amount of higher math.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">I should say at once that this book is not intended
as a replacement for dedicated books or courses;
the amount of depth is not comparable.
On the flip side, the benefit of this ‚Äúlight‚Äù approach
is that it becomes accessible to a larger audience,
since the goal is merely to give the reader a feeling for
any particular topic rather than to emulate a full semester of lectures.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">I initially wrote this book with talented high-school students in mind,
particularly those with math-olympiad type backgrounds.
Some remnants of that cultural bias can still be felt throughout the book,
particularly in assorted challenge problems which are
taken from mathematical competitions.
However, in general I think this would be a good reference
for anyone with some amount of mathematical maturity and curiosity.
Examples include but certainly not limited to:
math undergraduate majors, physics/CS majors,
math PhD students who want to hear a little bit
about fields other than their own,
advanced high schoolers who like math but not math contests,
and unusually intelligent kittens fluent in English.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Philosophy behind the Napkin approach</h2>

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As far as I can tell, higher math for high-school students
comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul id="Sx3.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="Sx3.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">‚Ä¢</span> 
<div id="Sx3.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Someone tells you about the hairy ball theorem in the form
‚Äúyou can‚Äôt comb the hair on a spherical cat‚Äù
then doesn‚Äôt tell you anything about why it should be true,
what it means to actually ‚Äúcomb the hair‚Äù,
or any of the underlying theory,
leaving you with just some vague notion in your head.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="Sx3.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">‚Ä¢</span> 
<div id="Sx3.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">You take a class and prove every result in full detail,
and at some point you stop caring about what the professor is saying.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="ltx_p">Presumably you already know how unsatisfying the first approach is.
So the second approach seems to be the default,
but I really think there should be some sort of middle ground here.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Unlike university, it is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> the purpose of this book to
train you to solve exercises or write proofs,<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Which is
not to say problem-solving isn‚Äôt valuable;
I myself am a math olympiad coach at heart.
It‚Äôs just not the point of this book.</span></span></span>
or prepare you for research in the field.
Instead I just want to show you some interesting math.
The things that are presented should be memorable and worth caring about.
For that reason, proofs that would be included for completeness
in any ordinary textbook are often omitted here,
unless there is some idea in the proof which I think is worth seeing.
In particular, I place a strong emphasis over explaining
why a theorem <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">should</em> be true rather than writing down its proof.
This is a recurrent theme of this book:</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.Thmtheorem1" class="ltx_theorem ltx_theorem_moral">
<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_runin ltx_title_theorem">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_theorem"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif ltx_font_bold" style="color:#186118;">Moral 0.0.1</span></span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif ltx_font_bold" style="color:#186118;"> ‚Äî </span>
</h6>
<div id="Sx3.Thmtheorem1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Natural explanations supersede proofs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">My hope is that after reading any particular chapter in Napkin,
one might get the following out of it:</p>
<ul id="Sx3.I2" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="Sx3.I2.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">‚Ä¢</span> 
<div id="Sx3.I2.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Knowing what the precise definitions are of the main characters,</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="Sx3.I2.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">‚Ä¢</span> 
<div id="Sx3.I2.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Being acquainted with the few really major examples,</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="Sx3.I2.i3" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">‚Ä¢</span> 
<div id="Sx3.I2.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Knowing the precise statements of famous theorems,
and having a sense of why they <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">should</em> be true.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="ltx_p">Understanding ‚Äúwhy‚Äù something is true can have many forms.
This is sometimes accomplished with a complete rigorous proof;
in other cases, it is given by the idea of the proof;
in still other cases, it is just a few key examples
with extensive cheerleading.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Obviously this is nowhere near enough if you want to e.g.¬†do research in a field;
but if you are just a curious outsider,
I hope that it‚Äôs more satisfying than the elevator pitch or Wikipedia articles.
Even if you do want to learn a topic with serious depth,
I hope that it can be a good zoomed-out overview before you really dive in,
because in many senses the choice of material is
‚Äúwhat I wish someone had told me before I started‚Äù.</p>

<section id="Sx4" class="ltx_section">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">More pedagogical comments and references</h2>

<div id="Sx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The preface would become too long if I talked about
some of my pedagogical decisions chapter by chapter,
so <a href="Pt23/ch_refs.html" title="Appendix A Pedagogical comments and references ‚Ä£ Part XXIII Appendix ‚Ä£ An Infinitely Large Napkin" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Appendix</span>¬†<span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a> contains those comments instead.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In particular, I often name specific references,
and the end of that appendix has more references.
So this is a good place to look if you want further reading.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Historical and personal notes</h2>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">I began writing this book in December 2014,
after having finished my first semester of undergraduate at Harvard.
It became my main focus for about 18 months after that,
as I became immersed in higher math.
I essentially took only math classes
(gleefully ignoring all my other graduation requirements),
and merged as much of it as I could
(as well as lots of other math I learned on my own time)
into the Napkin.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Towards August 2016, though, I finally lost steam.
The first public drafts went online then, and I decided to step back.
Having burnt out slightly,
I then took a break from higher math,
and spent the remaining two undergraduate years<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Alternatively:
‚Äú ‚Ä¶¬†and spent the next two years forgetting everything
I had painstakingly learned‚Äù.
Which made me grateful for all the past notes in the Napkin!</span></span></span>
working extensively as a coach for the American math olympiad team,
and trying to spend as much time with my friends as I could
before they graduated and went their own ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">During those two years, readers sent me many kind words of gratitude,
many reports of errors, and many suggestions for additions.
So in November 2018,
some weeks into my first semester as a math PhD student,
I decided I should finish what I had started.
Some months later, here is what I have.</p>

All the enthusiasm, encouragement, and thank-you notes I have received
over the years led me to begin writing this in the first place.
I otherwise would never have the arrogance to dream a project like this
was at all possible.
And of course I would be nowhere near where I am today were it not for the
life-changing journey I took in chasing my dreams to the IMO.
Forever TWN2!</p>
